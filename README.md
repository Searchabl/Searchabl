# Searchabl: Bookmark Manager for Chrome

Welcome to Searchabl, the bookmark manager for Chrome. Searchabl changes your Chrome new tab page to a beautiful way to search your bookmarks.
Manage hundreds of bookmarks easily, without spending hours finding the correct one.

## Limitations

* Searching is not optimal. If your bookmark is called "Hello, world," if you type "Hello world," it won't show up.
* Customization has not been built (yet - working on that).
* Doesn't look "at home" in Chrome

## Installation

The Chrome Webstore link will be available soon.

## To Do

- [ ] Customization
- [ ] Make it look "at home" in Chrome/Mac/Windows (maybe use Material UI or make it Mac themed on Mac and Windows theme on Windows)
- [ ] Popup to search by clicking icon in browser
- [ ] Show search results when there are no more bookmarks
- [ ] Allow switch to Particles Newtab
- [ ] More advanced search system - not only contains, but also wildcards in between every character
